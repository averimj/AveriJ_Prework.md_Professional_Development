### CHECKLIST MANIFESTO
As a new student and future developer, I believe having a checklist will help me stay on task. When I write stuff down (a checklist), it helps lessen my anxiety because I know what to expect and what needs to be done. 

As a human being, I'm guaranteed to make mistakes and forget things but if I have my responsibilities written down, it also guarantees that everything gets done.

For me, checklist are similar to how I set goals. Let's say my goal is to lose 20 pounds. It sounds good and its a very general statement but I have to be specific about how I plan to lose 20 pounds. 

The "How" is essentially my checklist.
- [ ] Drink 4 bottles of water
- [ ] Take the stairs at work
- [ ] Zumba on Tuesdays and Thursday from 6pm- 7pm
- [ ] Run for 30 minutes on Saturday


### 29 BEHAVIORS OF UNSTOPPABLE PROGRAMMERS
My top 3 behaviors are: 
* Use Google when struck...I've been learning on my own and when I get stuck I go straight to Google. I've found it to be really helpful when I know how to correctly word my question. The flip side is that sometimes I find myself searching on Google for hours on end. I need to know when to let it go.

* Always code review your own work first...It seems like common sense but it would avoid someone else having to go thru and correct silly mistakes that you could've fixed on your own. 

* Go play foosball. That's often more important than coding...Sometimes I can be so focused and don't want to get out of my groove. But studies have shown that a break every 90 minutes is healthy.  


### STRENGTH BASED APPROACH
#### What is your impression of strengths-based development? What questions do you have about this kind of development?
My impression of Strength Based Development is that companies figure out what a persons strengths are and capitalize on it. Literally bringing out the best in people and helping individuals realize their innate abilities and hone in on them.
In addition, if a person feels valued within an organization, I believe they'll work harder and more creatively because they're given the space and support to do so.

#### What do you feel are your top strengths? How do you know?
My top strengths are patience, kindness, a great listener, an easy/go with the flow attitude and I'm determined. I know this to be true because I'm self aware and I recently took the Pairin Personal Assessment and it listed me as:
* Dynamo
* Tugboat
* Calm, Cool and Collected
* Lover of Moderation

I also know my weakness is dealing with conflict. I often ask myself if I've adapted these strenghts to somehow protect myself by avoiding conflict.

#### How do you hope to develop your strengths for your new career in software development?
Using my strengths as a software developer will be most evident when working with teams. I notice who the introverts are in the room and  create an environment where all people feel comfortable, a place where they know their valued and respected for their individuality.
